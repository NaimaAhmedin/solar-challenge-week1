## Solar Energy Project

# Overview

# This project aims to create a web-based dashboard for visualizing and analyzing solar energy data. The dashboard allows users to upload their own cleaned solar dataset (CSV) and explore various aspects of solar energy, including average daily solar radiation, monthly solar radiation, and top months by average solar radiation.

# Key Features

Upload and visualize cleaned solar dataset (CSV)
Explore average daily solar radiation, monthly solar radiation, and top months by average solar radiation
Interactive dashboard with filtering and sorting capabilities
===

# Technical Details

Built using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web applications
Utilizes popular data science libraries, including Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib
Supports CSV file uploads and data visualization
===

# Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine
Install required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the application using streamlit run app/main.py
Upload your cleaned solar dataset (CSV) to the dashboard

# Example Use Cases

Visualize and compare solar radiation patterns across different months
Identify top months by average solar radiation
Explore the distribution of solar radiation across different countries
===

# Data Requirements

Cleaned solar dataset (CSV) with the following columns:
Month
DNI (Direct Normal Irradiance)
GHI (Global Horizontal Irradiance)
DHI (Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance)
